# Home Listing Price Prediction
Authors: Josh Lowy, Thomas Bergamaschi, Kevin Scheller

### Abstract:
The correct valuation of a home or residence can be critical to the finances of any family or business.  However, this problem is much
more complicated than counting beds and baths.  The use of machine learning enables us to model intricate relationship problems such
as home valuation with relative ease.  By using detailed home listing data, we have trained a model specific to the Sacramento area to
predict home price or rental price based on an assortment of property features.  Property price estimation is a much greater problem
than what our model and selection of features can grasp, but we aim to use this model as a starting point and reference for future
assessment.
