This lot had previously been fully approved for a single family residential permit. Most of the hard work, time, and investments have already been done for you! The driveway foundation and levee were permitted and installed. The Geo-engineering report was completed and available, along with the survey report, if the county still has it. The trees have been tagged, approved and removed on the building site and leach filed area. A dock is typically allowed as part of the garden highway specific plan. So come and build your dream home here on approximately 400 feet of serene river frontage.
