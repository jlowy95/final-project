As for the apartments, they're pretty awesome. The rooms are nice, the pool appealing, and the vibe is cool; but most apartments have this. What makes Vasari different?

Thank you for considering this furnished Master Bedroom Suite with Queen-size bed, desk space, and walk-in closet. The large Bath has double-vanity, seperate John, glassed shower stall, and deep soaking tub. This is a furnished three-bedroom home, and my sister Ruth is searching for the perfect woman housemate (no couples or kids please). I'm Ron her brother, co-owner and a RE Agent: happy to chat about your needs and set an app't. to meet Ruth and see the house.

Ruth's asking rent for this Master Bedroom is $780 per month if more than 2 months ($980 if less). But this Suite is available to WOMEN ONLY: Ruth and her other female housemate only want a Woman as 3rd housemate. You would also have use of the house to include the fully equipped kitchen, family room with cable TV, formal living and dining room, laundry room, and a separate TV/music room for private escapes for movies, reading and the like. The Housemates share in 1/3 each of the PG&E, cable/internet costs, water, sewer, & garbage, but we prefer to set a flat monthly Utility Fee: to cover your portion it would be $180 per month.

The location of the house is great: just off Hwy. 50 at Bradshaw, a few blocks down Goethe is the Sacramento County buildings. The house is just around the corner in the quiet neighborhood of new homes.
 
So if this home and room is of interest, do get back to us. And Ruth would love to set a time with you to see the place and to meet. Face to face it ll be fun for you to see if a Housemate situation might work for you. Call me!!

I am looking to rent the master bedroom in my 3 bedroom 2 bath home. You would have your own bathroom with a stand up shower as well as a ceiling fan in the bedroom. The house is located off Sunrise and Coloma in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. The house has a garage, backyard, dishwasher, internet, washer and dryer... typical house stuff. I am a 35 year old male and am open to any background as a renter. I like to work out, read, and garden. The house is a block from the American river trail. Possibly open to pets but would prefer not. No pets currently at the house. The other renter is a woman in her 50's who is very quiet and respectful. She works an 8 to 4 job and I am in the restaurant business. I work mostly nights, when the restaurants open back up that is. It is important to me to rent to a person who is quiet and respectful to the people around them. I occasionally smoke, cigarettes or weed, outside. I don't drink much but don't mind a few. No loud music, no yelling, no drama, no having a girlfriend over all the time who doesn't contribute to the bills, you get the picture. We will know if we are a fit when we chat. The room is 12 X 10 feet and is renting for $800 a month. A third of utilities and a deposit equal to the rent of the room also. Let me know and I'd love to chat on the phone or meet up so we can see if we are the right fit for one another.
Lease Details: 1/3 of utilities. Lease duration negotiable.

5 bedrooms total, one with private bath, four of the five bedrooms are HUGE.

ONE separate studio also available with kitchen, private bathroom, private garden, separate entrance and car garage STUDIO AVAILABLE July 1, 2020.

We make it easy to do absolutely NOTHING except study and work.

Rent ranges from $850 to $1200 per room. Studio is $1500/month (ALL UTILITIES AND MAID SERVICE INCLUDED) Maid service only for main house as studio we allow pets.

You will love the area which is very safe, two blocks to UC Davis medical center, coffee shops, freeway access is very close, Trader Joes down the street etc.

Prefer to rent to UC Davis medical students, residents, PA students, staff or nurses since it is steps away from the med center.

I am an ER doctor and know how hard it is going to medical school and being a resident/fellow so I make it simple and easy for you. Previous renters walk to work and do ""call"" from home as I am told it is faster to sleep at home, then in the hospital. You can see UC Davis Emergency department when you walk out the front door.
